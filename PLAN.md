# Plan

Completed phases are in `PLAN_ARCHIVE.md` (most recent: Phase 2 — DNS module testability; Phase 5 — dropped the `cookie-rs` fork; Phase 3 — `ifconfig.me` → Cloudflare `cdn-cgi/trace`; Phase 0 — push-to-deploy on the Mac mini; Phase 4 — `tray-wrapper` 0.4.1 bump).

## Phase 1 — Fix `get_recs_by_name` hardcoded `type=A` filter

**Symptom:** ACME cert renewal hangs forever in `DnsValidator::ensure_not_existing` polling for a stale `_acme-challenge` TXT record that never disappears.

**Root cause:** `CloudflareApi::get_recs_by_name` pinned the Cloudflare query to `type=A`. When `clean_proof` calls it for the `_acme-challenge` domain, Cloudflare returns 0 results (no A records exist there), the delete loop is a no-op, and no TXT records are ever removed. `ensure_not_existing` then polls indefinitely.

- [x] 1.1 Add a record-type parameter to `CloudflareApi::get_recs_by_name` (`rec_type: &str`) and use it in the query string.
- [x] 1.2 Update `clean_proof` (`cloudflare_client.rs`) to pass `"TXT"`.
- [x] 1.3 Update `update_dns` (`cloudflare_client.rs`) to pass `"A"` (preserves current behavior; keeps `Ipv4Addr::from_str(&rec.content)` parsing safe).
- [x] 1.4 `cargo build` + `cargo clippy` clean (only pre-existing warnings remain).
- [x] 1.5 `cargo test` passes.
- [ ] 1.6 Manual e2e: confirm the next real ACME renewal in prod succeeds — `clean_proof` deletes any leftover `_acme-challenge` TXT records before `create_proof` recreates them. The fix is live on the mini (shipped with the Phase 0 deploys), so this is "watch the next renewal", not "deploy and test". (Phase 2 added unit coverage for the URL-construction class of bug; an automated ACME-path e2e is still a gap — tracked in Phase 6.)
- [ ] 1.7 Docs: no CLAUDE.md changes needed (behavior fix, no architectural shift). Confirm and tick.

## Phase 6 — DNS follow-ups (parked)

Two items deferred out of Phase 2 — neither urgent, both real.

- [ ] 6.1 Higher-level tests for `CloudflareClient::clean_proof` / `create_proof` / `update_dns` (the set-arithmetic + sequencing logic). Requires `BASE_URL` in `cloudflare_api.rs` to stop being a `LazyLock<Url>` const and become a `CloudflareApi` field so a mock server URL can be injected; then use `wiremock` (decided in Phase 2.3 — `mockito` is fine too, `wiremock`'s async-first API fits the codebase better). Not built yet because the regression class that actually bit us (a pinned query param) is now covered by the pure URL-builder unit tests, and this is mostly orchestration.
- [ ] 6.2 Re-evaluate `DnsValidator`'s disabled timeout. The `//if … timeout …` blocks in `ensure_exists` / `ensure_not_existing` are commented out, so both are unbounded retry loops today. The original condition was also backwards (`timeout > Instant::now()` where `timeout = now + 300s` is true for the whole window → would bail on iteration 1; the corrected form `Instant::now() > timeout` is now in the comment). Re-enabling it is a *runtime behavior change* to the ACME path — a slow DNS propagation would make a renewal *fail* after 5 min instead of eventually succeeding. Decide whether bounded-with-bail or unbounded is what we want before flipping it on; if bounded, the `WaitStep` decision split from Phase 2.4 makes the loop easy to test with a short timeout.
