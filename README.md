## Todo List:
- [ ] Update building, I have a local git runner on my server, might as well use it
- [ ] I really need some code coverage, I left this project half done and I'm not sure if I've broken anything
- [ ] Need to figure out codesigning the server executable
- - Dylan has a great example here: https://github.com/dylanwh/lilguy/blob/main/macos/build.sh
- [ ] Consider migrating to daisyUI so that the UI parts work okay
- [ ] Need to figure out attachment resizing plus caching so I can really start uploading images / stl files.
- [ ] Probably will need to move behind Cloudflare's AI bot protection but that will change my server start up process
- [ ] Fix the sticky footer issue
